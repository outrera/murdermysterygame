Very high quality technology.\n    Currently we make a lot of components for the military.\n    Things like stabilizers on Tanks, or targeting systems for missiles.\n->Just cliff-notes if you don't mind.\n    Okay then. Short of it is we make military hardware.\n\nRecently Jacob had a change of heart about our business.\nHe decided that if we want to be an ethical company, we need to stop feeding war with our technology.\nNeedless to say, this didn't go down especially well with the shareholders.\n\nI tried to talk him out of it, but he's stubborn. Convinced his way is the only way.\n\n[[What were your movements last night?|Rachael.LastNight]]\n[[Just a moment, let me consult my notes|Rachael.Exit]]",
